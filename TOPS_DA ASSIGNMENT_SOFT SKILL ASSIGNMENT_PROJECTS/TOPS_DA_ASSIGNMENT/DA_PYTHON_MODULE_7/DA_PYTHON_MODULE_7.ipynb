    "# 17. What are negative indexes and why are they used?\n",
    "# -> Negative indexes in Python allow you to access elements from the end of a sequence (like lists, strings, or tuples). Instead of starting at 0 for the    first element, negative indexes start at -1 for the last element. For example, in a list my_list, my_list[-1] gives you the last element, and            my_list[-2] gives you the second-to-last element.\n",
    "\n",
    "# -> Uses of Negative Indexes:\n",
    "\n",
    "#     - Convenience: They enable easy access to elements at the end without needing to calculate the length of the sequence.\n",
    "#     - Clarity: They make code more readable. For example, my_list[-1] clearly indicates you want the last item, compared to calculating its index with                  len(my_list) - 1.\n",
    "#     - Slicing: They can be used in slicing to extract portions of a sequence from the end, such as my_list[-3:], which returns the last three elements.\n",
    "#                Overall, negative indexes enhance code simplicity and readability when dealing with sequences."

    "#     -> try block: Code that might cause an exception is placed here. Python will try to execute this code.\n",
    "#     -> except block: If an exception occurs in the try block, the code in the except block executes. This helps to handle errors without crashing the                         program.\n",
    "#     -> else block: Code in the else block runs if no exception was raised in the try block.\n",
    "#     -> finally block: This block always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurred, and is commonly used for cleanup actions.                                            (e.g., closing files).\n",

    "# 89. How Do You Handle Exceptions with Try/Except/Finally in Python? Explain with coding snippets\n",
    "# -> In Python, you can handle exceptions using the try, except, and finally blocks. This structure allows you to manage errors gracefully while ensuring     that certain code always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred. Here’s how each part works:\n",
    "#      1. try Block\n",
    "#          -> The try block contains code that might raise an exception. If an exception occurs, the control is passed to the corresponding except block.\n",
    "#      2. except Block\n",
    "#          -> The except block is used to handle specific exceptions that might be raised in the try block. You can have multiple except blocks to handle              different types of exceptions.\n",
    "#      3. finally Block\n",
    "#          -> The finally block contains code that will execute regardless of whether an exception occurred or was caught. This is useful for cleanup                  actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "# -> Explanation:\n",
    "#     -> try Block: The code attempts to divide num1 by num2.\n",
    "#     -> except ZeroDivisionError: If num2 is 0, this block will execute, printing an error message.\n",
    "#     -> except TypeError: If either num1 or num2 is not a number (like a string), this block will execute.\n",
    "#     -> else Block: If no exceptions occur, this block will print the successful division result.\n",
    "#     -> finally Block: This block executes no matter what, ensuring that any cleanup actions are performed. It always runs after the try and except                             blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# -> Summary:\n",
    "#     -> Use the try block to enclose code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "#     -> Handle specific exceptions in except blocks.\n",
    "#     -> Use the finally block for cleanup code that should always execute. \n",
    "# -> Example: The example is write down above shell."
