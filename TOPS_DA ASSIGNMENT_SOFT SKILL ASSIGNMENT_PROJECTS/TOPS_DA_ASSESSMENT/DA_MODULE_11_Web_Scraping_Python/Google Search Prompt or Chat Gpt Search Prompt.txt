Chatpt Prompt
Act as a B2B lead generation expert. I run a company called Diligence Outsourcing Pvt Ltd that provides remote Bookkeeping and Tax Preparation services to businesses across the USA. I want to find potential clients region by region, especially small businesses or CPA/accounting firms that have between 1 to 200 employees and are likely to outsource these services.

Give me a list of companies in [Insert Region or State, e.g., Texas] that:
1. Are CPA firms or small businesses likely to need bookkeeping or tax prep help.
2. Might be hiring or outsourcing remote bookkeepers or tax preparers.
3. Have fewer than 200 employees.

Please include for each lead:
- Company name
- Website
- Location (city, state)
- Type of business
- Contact person name (if available)
- Contact email or LinkedIn (if available)
- Indicate if theyâ€™ve posted about needing a bookkeeper or tax preparer

Start with [Insert Region/State] and generate 10 high-potential leads.
